## How Diffusion Models work?
  Train a diffusion model effectively. build a neural network that can predict noise in an image. 
  Adding context to the model so that you can control where you want it to generate. 
  And finally, by implementing advanced algorithms, how to accelerate the sampling process by 
  a factor of 10.
